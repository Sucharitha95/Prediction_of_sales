# Prediction_of_sales
This project helps to predict the sales using different machine learning algorithms

<h4><b>Requirements</b></h4>
1.Jupyter notebook<br>
2.Installation of all libraries and Modules into Jupyter notebook

<h4><b>Procedure of running the project</b></h4>
Step1: Install the jupyter notebook into the PC.<br>
Step2: Create a notebook to run the project.<br>
Step3: Download the ipynb file into the PC and Upload it into the Jupyter notebook.<br>
Step4: You should also download the dataset and upload it into the Jupyter notebook.<br>
Step5: Now you can predict the sales using all three algorithms Linear regression,Polynomial regression and XGBoost regression and also compare the efficiency.
